Is the format similar with Bash, Sed, Awk, Process Control
true, false -> waited on, read more on fork to answer true false
short answer -> explain fork
advice -> confuse how to take filename in bash, awk, c, python
bash 4 -> exact same question
sed 8 -> exact same question
awk 9 -> check oddline
python 11 -> exact same
python 12 -> exact same, capture last 4 numbers but don't change it
python 13 -> quite the same, careful with *()*, i don't understand which part is included, which part is excluded
C 14 -> simpler, just seek, read, write to swap data1 and data2
pipe already passed to me 
16 same, with "c" is "d", draw a diagram
C execl
