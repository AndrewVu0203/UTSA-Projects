Design pattern:
main method will call checkArray()
checkArray() will get result from accessingFileIntoArray() and check how many time the result happen.
accessingFileIntoArray() will responsible for:
-accessing File and Scanner(File) which is wrapped in Try/Catch. 
-get the result from Scanner(File) to an ArrayList 
-return that ArrayList
