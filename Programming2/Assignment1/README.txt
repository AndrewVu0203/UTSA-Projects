quarter, dime, nickel is 3 instances from my custom class Coin.java
Each is given a value when init, new Coin(x)
While balance < 100, then run the following code. 
	if quarter, dime, nickel have .getSide == "heads"
	then balance = balance + typeOfCoin;
If balance >= 100, then programs stop and output current balance and whether win or not.
